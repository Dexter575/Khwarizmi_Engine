# Khwarizmi_Engine
a Just in Time Compiler for Mathematical Expressions

The name is inspired by the Persian mathematician Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi, who is often referred to as "The Father of Algebra."
He coined the word "algorithm" back in the 9th century.

# Design Goals:
The user defines computations as a graph of operations on tensors.
-- It will have a Graph API designed to express common computation patterns in Computational Science.
-- Represent operations as nodes and tensors as edges, similar to a dataflow graph in a typical deep learning framework
